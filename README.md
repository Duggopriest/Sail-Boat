# Sail-Boat
using a MangoPi this project will host a website in which we can control and receive data from a model sailboat.

currently I will be baced all off a boat I am building that is modeled after the "HMS Victory".
due to the design of the boat the sail plan is rather complicated.

I will need to design the roping to go around the boat so that I can have all the stepper motors in one spot. 



the end goal is to have a page where we can control the sails with sliders.

far later on I will use this code to then make this a gps controlled boat where it can carry out waypoint missios.
